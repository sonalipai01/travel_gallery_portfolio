        <p> These are a few photos from my family trip to Italy in 2019. We first flew into Rome, where we toured the Colloseum 
            and other ancient buildings. Then, we took a 3-hour drive down the coast of Italy, and finally, arrived in the Amalfi
            Coast. This coast is famous for its breathtaking views, cerulean waters, and cute little towns, like Positano.

        <p> In 2015, I traveled to Cancun, Mexico with my one of my best friends and her family. We stayed at an all-inclusive resort called Omni
             Cancun Hotel & Villas, which had several pools, volleyball courts, and lots of food. The resort was located right on the beach, so we had 
             great views all the time. We also visited Xcaret, which was an adventure park about an hour away from the resort. The park had ziplining, swimming,
              tubing, shows, and more.
