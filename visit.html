        <h2 id="mald"> Maldives </h2>
        <div class="maldives">
            <img src="imgs/maldives_resort.jpg" class="m_img1" alt="Maldives Resort">
            <img src="imgs/swings.jpeg" class="m_img2" alt="Swings on the beach">

        </div>
        <p> One place I've wanted to go to since I was young is the Maldives. Located in the north-central Indian 
            Ocean, it consists of over 1,000 small islands, and is a very popular tourist destination. The resorts on
            the islands are famous for their luxury, with many of the hotels housing tourists in overwater villas -- some of
             which include water slides, pools, and direct access to the ocean.
        </p>
        <h2> Switzerland </h2>
        <div class="switzerland">
            <img src="imgs/interlaken.jpg" class="sz_img1" alt="Interlaken, Switzerland">
            <img src="imgs/winter.jpg" class="sz_img2" alt="Winter Wonderland">
            <img src="imgs/skydive.jpg" class="sz_img3" alt="Skydiving">
        </div>
        <p> There is no "perfect time" to visit Switzerland -- it is perfect year-round. The country looks like 
            Winter Wonderland during the snowy months, and the Swiss Alps look like a green paradise during the warmer
             months. I've always dreamed of skydiving or paragliding in Interlaken, a mountainous resort town popular
              among many tourists.
        </p>
        <h2> Australia </h2>
        <div class="australia">
            <img src="imgs/opera.jpeg" class="au_img1" alt="Opera House">
            <img src="imgs/bondi.jpg" class="au_img2" alt="Bondi Beach">
            <img src="imgs/kangaroo.jpeg" class="au_img3" alt="Kangaroo">
        </div>
        <p> Australia is home to an array of wildlife, adventures, and paradise. One of the most popular destinations
             in Australia is the Syndey Opera House, a performing arts center that hosts over 40 shows a week. You can 
             also find many white-sand beaches, such as Bondi Beach, which draw surfers, swimmers, and sunbathers. You can't miss 
             the exotic wildlife in Australia either, such as kangaroos, quokkas, koalas, and more.
